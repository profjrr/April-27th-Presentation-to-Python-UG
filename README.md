# April-27th-Presentation-to-Python-UG
Central Ohio Python Users Group Meeting -- Monday April 27th, 2015 at the Forge @1800hrs!
April 27th 2015 Monthly Meeting -- Making Even Better Decisions in Python 
This month, Professor Jim Reed will be talked about 
"Making Even Better Decisions in Python -- Using IFs with Supporting Assertions".
This talk is for both new Python programmers and old, and you will learn both about the syntax of Python as well as how to code better regardless of your language of choice.
While offering the NASA/JPL Coding Standards as a backdrop to this presentation--an attempt is made to adhere to these strict standards as Pythonists to develop clean coding habits and better decision making in their Python code. A brief overview of using Python IFs are correctly demonstrated in Python Code according to the NASA Standards presented earlier. A possible pseudo Case/Select Class is explored together as an alternative to Python IFs, but just might not past the test of meeting these self imposed coding standards. And finally, an introduction to the Python Assert Statement is provided with correct usage and demonstrating the suitable usefulness of Assertions for better program design from the beginning of your very next programming project.
